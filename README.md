:basketball: Description:
- This is a platform for you to search for current NBA players & Teams' information.
- Front end contains two html parts: **index.html** (players part) & **team.html** (teams parts)
- Back-end was written in **main.py**
  
<br>

:basketball: Guide 
- For player's part
Get the user input and call the API: https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction to render player's info to user, and follow the guide of: https://medium.com/@avinash.sarguru/getting-nba-player-pictures-for-you-application-6106d5530943 to get players' profile images.

- For team's info
Get the user input and call the API: https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction to render teams' info to user, in terms of team's image, since there's no any online open resourse with specific patterns to get teams' images, so I have created a separated teamlogo.py with every teams' image links and their names as keys.

```From 2023, the API to get players' ID has deprecated, which makes players profile image unavailable. I have made the accrodingly change on my code, and replaced profile image with unknown image.```
