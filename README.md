NBA Searching platform
Video Demo: https://youtu.be/hj5BEeZCG1M

This is a platform for you to search for 2021 NBA players & Teams' information.

The website contains two html parts: players part(index.html) & teams parts(team.html)
The script was written in main.py:
(For player's part)
Get the user input and call the API: https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction to render player's info to user, and follow the guide of: https://medium.com/@avinash.sarguru/getting-nba-player-pictures-for-you-application-6106d5530943 to get players' profile images.

(For team's info)
Get the user input and call the API: https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction to render teams' info to user, in terms of team's image, since there's no any online open resourse with specific patterns to get teams' images, so I have created a separated teamlogo.py with every teams' image links and their names as keys.
